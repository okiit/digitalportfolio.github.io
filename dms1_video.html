                    <br><p>For this work, I was provided with a random, Creative Commons 0 video and audio source which had absolutely no relation to the video. I was tasked to re-edit and re-purpose the video alongside the provided audio however was not allowed to use the video’s original audio, or the audio’s original video.</p>
                
                    <p>Approaching the project, I wanted to create a narrative. Knowing that while creating a narrative would be straightforward, as there are ‘rules’ to creating a narrative, I would need to maintain the narrative throughout the entire video. Being that the video and audio had no relation to each other, I would be limited with what I could use to carry on the narrative.</p>
            
                    <p>When analysing the content I was provided, I made sure to watch the video component muted completely, and the audio component with the video turned off. Since this work, I still haven’t heard the video’s original audio, or the audio’s original video.</p>
            
                <div class="VideoImages">
                    
                    <img src="images/assignment1_storyboard.png" width="50%" alt="My storyboard for this video project.">
            
                    <p><i>my working storyboard for the video, where i planned each shot and the narrative.</i></p>
                    
                </div>
                
                    <p>Given that the audio I was given was telling a love story between a dot and a line, I had to stop the audience from seeing a squirrel being put through a science experiment, and instead make them see a squirrel falling hopelessly in love with a peanut. I did this by making sure the audio cooperated with the visual, and that what the audio was saying could easily be interpreted by the visual.</p>
            
                    <p>Speed and Rhythm in editing can control the mood and feel of the video. For example, faster editing can create suspense, whereas slower editing can create calm and peace. In my work, I edited parts faster than others to create a feeling of being overwhelmed, and to emphasise certain aspects. I edited certain parts slower to create a feeling of serenity and peace.</p>
                
                    <p>After watching the video and listening to the provided audio, I took most of my inspiration from the existing narrative of the audio. I managed to find congruent elements between the audio and visual, and worked from there.</p>
                
                    <p>When I added music to my remixed video, I researched the origins of the audio, as there was some existing music in the audio. By keeping the date of composition in mind for the audio, I was able to find music from that same period and have it match the ‘aesthetic’ of the audio and video.</p>
